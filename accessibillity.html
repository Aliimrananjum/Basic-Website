                To ensure that this webpage is compatible with a group of diverse users our team had to take great steps
                to fulfil the resolution. To begin with the team openly discussed the aspect of universal design and
                inclusive design related to webpage to set a clear understanding for ourselves on what the topic itself
                means. Our understanding came to this that the goal with UD and ID is to ensure that our webpage is
                available to as many users possible, regardless of the user’s impediment or hindrance. Therefore, our
                team listed up disabilities that would make our website less effective with those users with that
                disability. Doing so we would have a roadmap on how to make our webpage more inclusive.

            <div class="access-grid">
                <div class="tittle">
                    <h2>What have we done?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To ensure that users with color blindless, low vision or even blindness had the opportunity to
                        use our website we had to take some actions. At first, our webpage did not take fully advantage
                        of screen reader, therefore our team ensure that it was possible for a blind user to navigate
                        through the website. Very similar is to be able to tab the keyboard focusable parts for users
                        with motor impairment. To make it simpler to navigate our page we added a “skip to content
                        button” and made image alts as descriptive as possible, even adding the text “menu” to our menu
                        logo.
                    </p>

            <div class="tittle">
                <p>
                    Then we proceeded to check the colors on our page, settling on a simple color palette of
                    white, black, yellow and blue for our links. We still did contrast checks and testing the page
                    with filter: grayscale (1). We also made our text rather large to make zooming in on a page
                    unneeded, including keeping sans-serif so it is easier to read. Though a problem could be our
                    idea for our front-page image becoming a transparent background when faced with smaller screens
                    or our menu tab focus being transparent.
                    Finally, with users suffering from cognitive impairment in mind we focused on a simple layout
                    and having easy to read text.

                    After looking at disabilities we took the web page through varies tests to ensure that no
                    problems will incur while using our web page. First off, we checked our <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> with a
                    <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">CSS validator</a>
                    and our <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> with a
                    <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML validator</a>.
                    There we found some small problems, for example
                    background none instead of transparent, hierarchy problems created by
                    &#60;h1&#62;/&#60;h2&#62;/&#60;h3&#62; or what elements
                    were allowed inside a label. After that we proceeded to test the sites on accessibility
                    checker
                    called <a href="http://checkers.eiii.eu/" target="_blank">Eaccesability</a>. our first test
                    showed a miniscule number of problems, but after
                    some editing, we passed it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="access-grid">
                <div class="tittle">
                    <p>
                        Last of all was Achecker, where we only had 2 known problem
                        across
                        the total of pages, one being the use of &#60;i&#62; tag instead of &#60;strong&#62;, the other
                        being that &#60;label&#62; cannot be empty. Since
                        we
                        didn’t have any likely problems, we moved onto potential problems. A lot of them were about
                        the
                        alt in the images and things to make the page a little better, but a lot of them didn’t make
                        sense so we skipped over them. An example is a “skip to content” button, but we already had
                        one.
                        But in went through the checker and added what made sense, like
                        &#60;span lang=””&#62; for the Norwegian mail.
                    </p>

                <img src="img/Achecker.png" alt="A screenshot of Acheker showing that the label tag cannot be empty"

                <p>
                    We have also deliberately chosen to not use JavaScript, due to not having it in our curriculum. In
                    order to have more function in our website, we had to find creative solutions to our limitations.
                    This caused some problems for the accessibility of our page. In one case, Achecker promted that the
                    &#60;label&#62; had to contain letters. Due to our design of our navigation bar, we found a workaround to
                    use a unicode that only contained a space. This solution passed the test.
