                    <p>The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was to secure the individual’s 
                        right of privacy and their personal data. The regulation was incorporated into Norwegian legislation 
                        in June 2018. Since then, many Norwegian corporations had to make several changes in their terms 
                        and regulations in order to satisfy the requirements of the GDPR. One of our experiences with the 
                        GDPR will be discussed in this assignment.</p>

                    <h2>endre</h2>
                    <p>One of the consequences of the GDPR was that the conditions for obtaining consent became stricter. 
                        During our discussion on the subject, we had discovered that the online store Tights.no, had prechecked a box that gave them consent to send you newsletters when you check out an order. In 
                        accordance with The Marketing Control Act Section 15 first paragraph, it states that it is prohibited to 
                        direct marketing communication without the consent of the recipient. (Lovdata, 2009)

                    <h2>endre</h2>
                    <p>Based on a natural linguistic understanding of the wording “consent”, you have to make an active 
                        action in order to give a consent. Neither passivity nor silence would ever meet the requirements of a 
                        content. This is also stated by case law, in this case C-673/17 – Planet 49. The Court of Justice of the 
                        European Union made it clear that a consent had to be active and unambiguous in order to satisfy 
                        the requirements of the GDPR. (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2019) Finally though, 
                        Tights.no has corrected their error.

                    <p>It comes with great power when you handle personal and private data. The GDPR is to set 
                        boundaries to assure that the professional party cannot take advantage of an individual. It ensures 
                        that you have a responsibility for any information is processed in compliance with the law.
