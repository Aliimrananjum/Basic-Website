                    about you, and whether they share information about you to third parties. Is it easy to find and

                    <p>We have always been aware that big tech companies were using our data to “better understand our
                        needs” and make a “better and more personalized experience” for their users, amongst other
                        excuses, however what we were not aware of is how much data and the type of data they gather.
                        Bizarre metrics about us we never knew we shared with the Web. </p>

                    <h2>endre</h2>
                    <p>One look at Instagram’s official Data Policy web page (Instagram, 2021) and you’ll feel
                        overwhelmed with all the different ways your data is stored and why they chose to archive said
                        data. For example; they store different metrics about your device's camera, system storage space
                        and devices connected to the same network as you. Things that you would probably never share on
                        your own if asked to.</p>

                    <h2>endre</h2>
                    <p>So the information about data and privacy is available to you, if you look for it that is. What
                        you’re actually agreeing to share when signing up for Instagram isn’t made obvious for you. You
                        won’t get a pop-up saying: “You’re about to share your love for SHEEP in IRELAND with a whole
                        lot of third party companies, are you sure you want this?” (BBC News, 2018) Of course there is
                        the possibility that this actually is presented to you, in the infamous “terms and conditions,”
                        that no one actually reads.</p>

                    <h2>endre</h2>
                    <p>Jokes aside, this could be a good place to begin. Make these terms more available and easily
                        accessible to the users. We shouldn’t have to dig for the information or wait for a big scandal
                        to expose them. Visualize clearly why Instagram (Facebook) wants this particular data from us
                        and what it will be used for. They’re getting rich on our data, we might as well have access to
                        it ourselves.</p>
