                    <h2>Implementation of <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h2>
                    <p>The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation was to secure the individual’s
                        right of privacy and their personal data. The regulation was incorporated into Norwegian
                        legislation
                        in June 2018. Since then, many Norwegian corporations had to make several changes in their terms
                        and regulations in order to satisfy the requirements of the GDPR. One of our experiences with
                        the
                        <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> will be discussed in this
                        assignment.

                    <h2>The Consequences</h2>
                    <p>One of the consequences of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> was
                        that the conditions for obtaining consent became stricter.
                        During our discussion on the subject, we had discovered that the online store Tights.no, had
                        pre-checked a box that gave them consent to send you newsletters when you check out an order. In
                        accordance with The Marketing Control Act Section 15 first paragraph, it states that it is
                        prohibited to
                        direct marketing communication without the consent of the recipient. (Lovdata, 2009)

                    <h2>Consent</h2>
                    <p>Based on a natural linguistic understanding of the wording “consent”, you have to make an active
                        action in order to give a consent. Neither passivity nor silence would ever meet the
                        requirements of a
                        content. This is also stated by case law, in this case C-673/17 – Planet 49. The Court of
                        Justice of the
                        European Union made it clear that a consent had to be active and unambiguous in order to satisfy
                        the requirements of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>. (Court of
                        Justice of the European Union, 2019) Finally though,
                        Tights.no has corrected their error.
