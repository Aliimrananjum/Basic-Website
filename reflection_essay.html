                    <h3>Looking back</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you were to ask me "would you have done it again?" then I must have thought extra carefully about what I would answer. 
                        It is not the case that I have had a bad experience, on the contrary,
                        I have had a very good time as a student. Now you will hear why I instinctively did not answer "Yes!"
                        Im currently taking my first year at Oslomet through a three-term program. 
                        This means that as a student I have to take several subjects in addition to the regular study program. 
                        A regular study course is already demanding, especially when you are a brand new student, taking several subjects on the side does not make it much easier.

                    <h3>Biggest Challange</h3>
                    <p>The measures that followed with the pandemic created a great challenge for me. 
                        After I got my study place confirmed, I used to daydream about what my school would look like everyday. 
                        What I often imagined was a large auditorium full of students with great ambitions. Furthermore, I thought about fellow students who were going to be my new friends,
                        and at the same time I was excited about all the student parties that were to come. Unfortunately, this has not been the case.
                        Since you spend a lot of your everyday life following teaching from a computer, this has led me to feel lonely 
                        and have in some periods lost motivation because everyday life becomes so monotonous.</p>

                    <h3>Worklife vs Studentlife</h3>
                    <p>After working for a company for over 8 years, I thought it was time for something new. 
                        One day I decided to quit my job to get an education. I have not regretted that choice. 
                        When I look back on how my life was before, there is little I recognize myself in. 
                        What has been the biggest difference from my time when I was at work was how little I cared about sleep. 
                        As a student, I have felt the importance of being healthy and obvious for the brain to perform optimally, and this has meant that I now have a fixed routine at bedtime. 
                        Furthermore, I dont exercie as much as before, however i ensure to have a high intensety training for min two times a week.
                        Another difference is that I have less time for friends and family, I think that is just fine as you receive more benifits of studying.

                    <h3>Learning to code</h3>
                    <p>For me, it was easy to see that society was in a drastic technological development. It was
                        obvious that the labor market had a great need for a labor force that had the ability to
                        lift the digital development even higher. That notion inspired me to learn to code.
                        It has been an exciting semester because at school I learned the basics of Java
                        and <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> / <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and I'm looking forward to mastering it completely.
                        I understand that Java language is something that teaches you the fundamentals of coding, and with that you can
                        easily pass on the knowledge and learn other languages.
                        Web Programming course has been a eye-opening expericen.
                        The lectures on web programming have given me a good understanding of what a website is like
                        built up. </p>

                    <h3>"Yes" or "No"</h3>
                    <p>The answer is "Yes!" I would have done it again if I had to choose.
                        There have been long days with myself and the computer, not very social and less lucrative
                        diet.
                        It's all worth it! On the other hand, I have no other choice either. As mentioned above,
                        society is in a development, to be a part of this development you have to take someone
                        significant grips in life, otherwise the probability of falling off is high.
                        I have expanded my mind, gotten to know new people and learned something that can be
                        in use for the rest of my life, all this as a result of my first semester at <abbr title="Oslo Metropolitan University">Oslomet</abbr>.
